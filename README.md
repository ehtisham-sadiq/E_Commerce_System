#### Development Workflow

**Branching Strategy**

The project follows a feature branch workflow to ensure isolated development and easy integration.

1.	Create a feature branch:
```
    git checkout -b feature/{feature_name}
```

2.	Push your branch to the remote repository:
```
    git push origin feature/{feature_name}
```

3.	Once your feature is complete, open a Pull Request to the main branch. Ensure that the code passes tests and review before merging.
